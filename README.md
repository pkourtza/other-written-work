  A short assessment of how online reviews on Trustpilot can assist in consumer decisions in terms of energy supplier. Description of Trustpilot's scoring method, trustworthiness and current use in the energy retail sector by the UK public. The report also includes recommendations on how online reviews can be expanded in the retail energy industry by users, reviewer sites and the regulator.
* The use of annotations for storytelling with data in business.
  An academic analysis on the use of annotations in data visualisations with a focus on business settings. The report describes the role of explanatory annotations, both visual and written, and illustrates their use through a literature review. Also, it analyses the key principles for effective use of annotations in visualisations and exemplifies these principles via an empirical case study.
